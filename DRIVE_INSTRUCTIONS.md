# Reproducing our results

Download dataset_clean and weights_results, place them in the same directory as the code.
Follow instructions in the README.md file.

## Folders structure

- dataset : contains the whole dataset. Not recommended downloading as it contains a lot of test data.
- dataset_clean : contrains a dataset with only the data needed for training and validation in the code. USE TO TRAIN AND VALIDATE
- results : contains statistics of model evaluation and inference using our new evaluation method. Contains output images and stats as csv.
- weights : contains the previous weights of the models tested in the lab. Provided for completeness, not useful for our results.
- weights_results : contains the weights of the models used in the report. USE TO REPRODUCE RESULTS DURING INFERENCE AND EVALUATION
- brain_data.zip : contains the whole unannotated dataset. Not recommended downloading as it is very large.
